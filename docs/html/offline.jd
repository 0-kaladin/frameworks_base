<h1>Welcome to the Android SDK!</h1>

<img src="{@docRoot}assets/images/home/sdk-large.png" style="float:right; margin:-2em 3em 3em;" />

<h3>If you've downloaded the Android SDK for the first time...</h3>

<p>Complete the online guide to 
<a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/{@sdkCurrent}/installing.html">Installing 
the Android SDK</a>, which will help you setup your development environment
(including the Android Development Tools plugin for Eclipse) 
so you can start developing Android apps.</p>

<p>Once your environment is setup, look at the
<a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/{@sdkCurrent}/installing.html#NextSteps">Next
Steps</a> for some pointers that will teach you about Android and get you started.</p>

<h3>If you've updated an existing SDK using the <em>SDK and AVD Manager</em>...</h3>

<p>There's no additional setup.</p>

<p>Newly installed Android platforms are automatically saved in the 
<code><em>&lt;sdk_dir>/</em>platforms/</code> directory of your existing SDK;
new add-ons are saved in the <code><em>&lt;sdk_dir>/</em>add-ons/</code>
directory; and new documentation is saved in the existing
<code><em>&lt;sdk_dir>/</em>docs/</code> directory (old docs are replaced).</p>

<p>Note that you are currently viewing a local, offline version of the
Android developer documentation. The offline documentation offers almost all the same
content and features as the online documentation. Because some features
such as search and videos are network-based, not everything will work if you
are not connected to the Internet.<br/><br/>
