<h1>Welcome to the Android SDK!</h1>

<img src="{@docRoot}images/android_icon_125.png" style="float:right; margin:1em 6em 6em;" />

<p>If you've just downloaded the SDK, then continue with the 
<a href="{@docRoot}sdk/1.1_r1/installing.html">Installing</a> guide.</p>

<p>If you're upgrading from a previously installed version, then refer to the 
<a href="{@docRoot}sdk/1.1_r1/upgrading.html">Upgrading</a> guide.</p>

<p>Once you've completed the SDK installation, you can start learning about development on the Android framework
by reading the <em><a href="{@docRoot}guide/index.html">Dev Guide</a></em>. And don't forget that the SDK comes packaged with
a wide variety of very helpful code <a href="{@docRoot}samples/index.html">samples</a>.</p>

<p>Please note that you are currently viewing a local, offline version of the Android developer documentation. 
The offline documentation will behave just like the online documentation, except searches in the above
search bar will not work. However, the search bar is still able to provide auto-completion for package and class names,
which can help you quickly find reference documentation for specific classes that you remember.
If you'd like fully searchable documentation, please visit
<a href="http://developer.android.com/index.html">http://developer.android.com</a>.</p>
