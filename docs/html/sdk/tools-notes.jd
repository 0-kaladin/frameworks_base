<h3>Dependencies</h3>

<p>SDK Tools 3 is compatible with ADT 0.9.4 and later, but not

<strong>must</strong> update your ADT plugin to version 0.9.4 or higher if you
install SDK Tools 3 in your SDK. </p>

<h3>Android tool</h3>
<ul>
<li>Adds new <code>android create test-project</code> and <code>android update
test-project</code> commands to allow for greater flexibility in the location of the
main and test projects.</li>
</ul>

<h3>DDMS</h3>
<ul>
<li>Adds a button to dump HPROF file for running appplications (app must be able
to write to the sdcard).</li>
<li>Button to start/stop profiling of a running application (app must be able to

an AVD.</li>
<li>Provides improved AVD creation UI, which lets you customize the hardware
properties of your AVDs.</li>
