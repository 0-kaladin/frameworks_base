<p>This document provides version-specific information about Android SDK releases. For the latest known issues, please ensure that you're viewing this page at: <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/RELEASENOTES.html">http://developer.android.com/sdk/RELEASENOTES.html</a>.</p>

<h2>Android 1.1 SDK, Release 1</h2>

<p>This SDK provides the development tools and Android system image you need to create applications for Android-powered devices. Applications developed on this SDK will be compatible with mobile devices running the Android 1.1 platform. </p>

<p>This release provides an updated system image (Android 1.1), updated documentation, and the same set of development tools provided in the Android 1.0 r2 SDK. The updated system image includes bug fixes and some smaller features, as well as a few minor API changes from the 1.0 version. </p>

<p>For details about the Android 1.1 system image included in the SDK &mdash; including bug fixes, features, and API changes &mdash; please read the <a href="{@docRoot}sdk/android-1.1.html">Android 1.1 Version Notes</a>.</p>

<h3>App Versioning for Android 1.1</h3>

<p>If you are using this SDK to build an application that is compatible <em>only</em> with Android-powered devices running the Android 1.1 platform, please note that you <strong>must</strong> set the the <code>android:minSdkVersion</code> attribute in the application's manifest to the API Level of Android 1.1 &mdash; "2".</p>

<p>Specifically, you specify the <code>android:minSdkVersion</code> attribute in a <code>&lt;uses-sdk&gt;</code> element as a child of <code>&lt;manifest&gt;</code> in the manifest file. When set, the attribute looks like this: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;manifest&gt;
  ...
  &lt;uses-sdk minSdkVersion="2"&gt;
  ...
&lt;/manifest&gt;</code>
</pre>

<p>By setting <code>android:minSdkVersion</code> in this way, you ensure that users will only be able to install your application if their devices are running the Android 1.1 platform. In turn, this ensures that your application will function properly on their devices, especially if it uses APIs introduced in Android 1.1. </p>

<p>If your application uses APIs introduced in Android 1.1 but does not declare <code>&lt;uses-sdk minSdkVersion="2"&gt;</code>, then it will run properly on Android 1.1 devices but <em>not</em> on Android 1.0 devices. </p>

<p>If your application does not use any new APIs introduced in Android 1.1, you can indicate Android 1.0 compatibility by removing <code>minSdkVersion</code> or setting the attribute to "1". However, before publishing your application, you must make sure to compile your application against the Android 1.0 system image (available in the Android 1.0 SDK), to ensure that it builds and functions properly for Android 1.0 devices. You should test the application against system images corresponding to the API Levels that the application is designed to be compatible with.</p>

<p>If you are sure your application is not using Android 1.1 APIs and has no need to use them, you might find it easier to keep working in the Android 1.0 SDK, rather than migrating to the Android 1.1 SDK and having to do additional testing.</p>


<h3>ADT Plugin Compatibility</h3>

<p>For this version of the SDK &mdash; Android 1.1 SDK, Release 1
&mdash; the compatible version of the Android Development Tools (ADT)
Plugin for Eclipse is <strong>0.8.0</strong>. If you are using a
previous version of ADT, you should update to the latest version for use
with this SDK. For information about how to update your ADT plugin, see
<a href="{@docRoot}sdk/1.1_r1/upgrading.html#update-plugin">Upgrading
the SDK</a>.</p>

<h3>Installation and Upgrade Notes</h3>

<p>If you've been developing an application using an Android 1.0 SDK no
changes to your application are needed. You may want to wipe application
user data (emulator option <code>-wipe-data</code>) when running your
application on the Android 1.1 emulator for the first time.</p>

<p>If you're installing the Android SDK for the first time, please see
the instructions in <a
href="{@docRoot}sdk/1.1_r1/installing.html">Installing the SDK</a>.

<h3>Other Notes</h3>

<p><strong>MapView API Key</strong></p>

<p>com.google.android.maps.MapView is a class that lets you
easily integrate Google Maps into your application. Before you can
access the maps data, you will need to register with the Google Maps
service and receive a Maps API Key, which you then add to your MapView
for authentication to the server.</p>

<p>Developers should note that the registration service for MapView is now
active and Google Maps is actively enforcing the Maps API Key requirement. 
For information about how to register for a Maps API Key, see 
<a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/location/geo/mapkey.html">
Obtaining a Maps API Key</a>.</p>

<p><strong>USB Drivers for Windows</strong></p>

<p>If you using Windows and want to develop or test your application on an
Android-powered device (such as the T-Mobile G1), you need an appropriate USB
driver. For your convenience, the Windows version of the Android SDK includes
these USB drivers that you can install, to let you develop on the device:</p>

<ul>
<li>USB driver for 32-bit XP and Vista</li>
<li>USB driver for 64-bit Vista only</li>
</ul>

<p>The USB driver files are located in the
<code>&lt;SDK&gt;/usb_driver</code> directory. For details and
installation instructions, see <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/developing/device.html#setting-up">Setting Up a
Device for Development</a>.</p>
</p>

<h3>Resolved Issues, Changes</h3>

<p><strong>Emulator</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Emulator now saves the user image in &lt;android&gt;/SDK1.1/</code></li>
</ul>

<h3>Known Issues</h3>

<p><strong>JUnit and Eclipse/ADT</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you are developing in Eclipse/ADT and want to add JUnit test
classes, you can do so. However, you need to set up a custom JUnit configuration
before your tests will run properly. For detailed information about how to set
up the JUnit configuration, see the troubleshooting topic <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/appendix/faq/troubleshooting.html#addjunit">Running a Junit test class
in Eclipse</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Other</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>It is not possible to send MMS messages between emulator instances. </li>
<li>In some cases, you may encounter problems when using the browser on an
emulator started with the command-line option <code>-http-proxy</code>. </li>
<li>We regret to inform developers that Android 1.1 will not include support for
dot-matrix printers.</li>
<li>On the OSX platform, if you manually remove the ~/.android directory
using <code>rm -rf ~/.android</code>, then try to run 
the emulator, it crashes. This happens because the emulator fails to create 
a new .android directory before attempting to create the child SDK1.0 directory.
To work around this issue, manually create a new .android directory using
<code>mkdir ~/.android</code>, then run the emulator. The emulator 
creates the SDK1.0 directory and starts normally. </li>
<li>The final set of Intent patterns honored by Android 1.0 has not yet been
fully documented. Documentation will be provided in future releases.</li>
<li>In ADT Editor, you can add at most ten new resource values at a time,
in a given res/values/*.xml, using the form in the Android Resources pane. 
If you add more than ten, the Android Resources pane will not display the
attributes fields for the additional resource entries. To work around this 
problem, you can close the file in the editor and open it again, or you 
can edit the resource entries in the XML text mode. </li>
<li>The emulator's battery-control commands (<code>power &lt;option&gt</code>)
are not working in this release.</li>
</ul>
